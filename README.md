This repository contains the R Projects and the necessary files to reproduce our paper titled:  India Benefits Greatly if More of its Daughters are Sent to School. 

This paper attempts to find the correlation between female enrolment in school and sexual, reproductive health, and health of children using data from the 1992 DHS survey across 25 states in India. When analyzing sexual and reproductive health we looked at the following factors – number of child marriages, use of contraceptives, utilization of antenatal care. When analyzing health of future generations, we looked at the following factors – percentage of children who are vaccinated and percentage of children that are underweight. Based on our analysis it is evident that there is a strong correlation between female education and sexual, reproductive health, and health of children.
